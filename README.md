# Mustard Party 2

Mustard Party 2 is a mobile game originally implemented in The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit.    
Chris, the main character, can play it on his father's phone during the gameplay.

As a big fan of the Life is Strange game series, I decided to create the most similar clone of Mustard Party 2 using Unity.    
Hope I succeded.
